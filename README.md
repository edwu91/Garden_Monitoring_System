# Garden_Monitoring_System
Code for RPI to monitor and water garden.  
the code base is for running a water monitoring system on a raspberry pi 4.  
There are a few mechanical components and eletronics required to start this system.  
The point of this project is to create an simple watering system using off the shelf DIY eletronics and mechanical systems.  
This is to decrease cost and lead time for custom parts.  
<br />  
Parts Required:  
1) Raspberry Pi 4 board
2) Box to put all the components into
3) various 2 pin connectors (preferably waterproof)
4) 4x relay module https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-4-channel-relay-module
5) 4x capacitive moisture meter https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Capacitive_Moisture_Sensor-Corrosion-Resistant/
6) No IR cut RPI camera module
7) light meter BH1750 https://www.instructables.com/BH1750-Digital-Light-Sensor/
8) temperature sensor BMP280 https://www.adafruit.com/product/2651
9) 80/20 or bosch tubing to to mount sprinker system
10) misting kit with tubing
11) 12V DC solenoid ball valve 3/4" NPT for standard pipe fittings
12) arduino board with screw terminals
13) 2pin screw terminal to bulkhead connector (can DIY this with at home connectors if needed, but is so arduous to do...)


Load all python code onto raspberry pi  
load all arduino code onto the arduino  
After purchasing all the parts, you can assemble everything together using the gms.sch for testing purposes.   
Drill some holes into your box to assemble and mount in an enclosure.  
put all components with wiring harness attached to all parts into box and secure in place with mwhatever method you chose (see pictures for details)
